# CIDcons
For now, this font includes the icons used on the subnational projects. Eventually it will include all custom icons that CID uses, so long as the files don't get prohibitively large.

## How to add a new font
Just drag `config.json` or the whole project's `zip` archive to the appropriate area on [Fontello](http://fontello.com/).

Of course, you'll need to save the additional icons as svgs first before you add them. The illustrator file is included in the repo as well. Please use it. The artboards should have the expanded, compound path versions of the icons. Place the source version below them, off the artboard. The artboards should be scaled to match the size of the icon. Please align all icons as close to the pixel grid as possible to prevent fuzzy edges as smaller sizes. You can press `cmd` + `'` to see the grid.
