# CIDcons
For now, this font includes the icons used on the subnational projects. Eventually it will include all custom icons that CID uses, so long as the files don't get prohibitively large.

## How to add a new font
Just drag `config.json` or the whole project's `zip` archive to the appropriate area on [Fontello](http://fontello.com/).

Of course, you'll need to save the additional icons as svgs first before you add them. The illustrator file is included in the repo as well. Please use it. The artboards should have the expanded, compound path versions of the icons. Place the source version below them, off the artboard. The artboards should be scaled to match the size of the icon. Please align all icons as close to the pixel grid as possible to prevent fuzzy edges as smaller sizes. You can press `cmd '` to see the grid.

## Why so many CSS files ?

- basic file, <your_font_name>.css - is usually enough, it contains @font-face
  and character code definitions

- *-ie7.css - if you need IE7 support, but still don't wish to put char codes
  directly into html

- *-codes.css and *-ie7-codes.css - if you like to use your own @font-face
  rules, but still wish to benefit from css generation. That can be very
  convenient for automated asset build systems. When you need to update font -
  no need to manually edit files, just override old version with archive
  content. See fontello source code for examples.

- *-embedded.css - basic css file, but with embedded WOFF font, to avoid
  CORS issues in Firefox and IE9+, when fonts are hosted on the separate domain.
  We strongly recommend to resolve this issue by `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
  server headers. But if you ok with dirty hack - this file is for you. Note,
  that data url moved to separate @font-face to avoid problems with <IE9, when
  string is too long.

- animate.css - use it to get ideas about spinner rotation animation.


Attention for server setup
--------------------------

You MUST setup server to reply with proper `mime-types` for font files -
otherwise some browsers will fail to show fonts.

Usually, `apache` already has necessary settings, but `nginx` and other
webservers should be tuned. Here is list of mime types for our file extensions:

- `application/vnd.ms-fontobject` - eot
- `application/x-font-woff` - woff
- `application/x-font-ttf` - ttf
- `image/svg+xml` - svg
